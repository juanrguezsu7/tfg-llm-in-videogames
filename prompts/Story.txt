--Start of Story--
The island, simply known by its inhabitants as “The Island”, has been home to generations of settlers who have learned to live with its fertile lands, crystal-clear waters, and imposing mountains. However, in recent years, a shadow of fear has fallen upon them: The Patch, an island shrouded in a thick pink mist that has begun to emit strange lights and alter the region’s climate.

Since time immemorial, The Patch has been a forbidden place. Its ancient ruins and broken trees, have been the subject of legends and superstitions. It is said that those who set foot on its ground without permission will be condemned to wander the mist for eternity. No one has ever returned to disprove it.

Despite attempts to keep people away, whispers of hidden power and ancient knowledge tempt the most daring. What truly lies within The Patch? Is it merely a forgotten ruin, or does it hold something far more dangerous?

**Main Areas of the Island**
- Great Town
The heart of the island, Great Town is the center of commerce, politics, and social life. A bustling place where decisions are made, secrets are traded, and tensions rise with each passing day.

- Sarah’s Rest
A peaceful village in the southwest, known for its farming and craftsmanship. Recently, something strange has begun affecting the land—subtle changes in the crops, odd shifts in the wind and angry bears coming from the Forbidden Mountains. The villagers whisper about unnatural forces at work.

- Sapphire
A small fishing harbor to the northeast, where old superstitions and maritime legends are taken seriously. Tales of shadows lurking beneath the waves and unnatural storms keep the fishermen wary of venturing too far.

- Angel’s Isle
A small island in the far west separated from the mainland by a stretch of sea. A place of solitude and mystery, it remains one of the few locations still untouched by the growing fear surrounding The Patch. It has a giant Angel statue in the middle. The statue is said to be a guardian of the island, but its true purpose remains a mystery. Some believe it holds the key to understanding the strange occurrences on the island, while others fear it may be a harbinger of doom.

- Diana's Square
A place of gatherings in the east coast, near The Patch, announcements, and public debates. Lately, it has become a hub of speculation and paranoia regarding the strange occurrences across the island.

- The Forbidden Passage
A treacherous path winding through The Mountain in the south. Many believe it leads to an ancient temple, while others say it is nothing but a trap for the foolish and the desperate.

- North Cave & South Cave
Two caverns, one hidden in the northern reaches and the other shrouded in mystery to the south. Those who seek the truth of the island may find their answers here—or never return at all.

- West Cave & East Cave
Two more caverns, they are ordinary places where people go to find shelter or solitude. Animals seek refuge in them, and some say they are connected to the island’s past.

- Pleasant Valley
A lush valley in the center-north of the island, where the flora and fauna thrive in harmony. However, recent reports of strange creatures and unexplained phenomena have cast a shadow over its tranquility.

- The Mountains
The natural barriers of the isle, one in the north and the other in the south. They are said to be home to ancient spirits and guardians, watching over the land with silent eyes. No one has ever dared to climb their peaks or go to the other side of the mountains.

- The Patch
The heart of the unknown in the far east. The Patch is an island which has in the middle a giant magical pink pool that has recently begun emitting a disturbing energy, giving raise to some strange events. Those who have tried to approach it were repelled by an unseen force. However, one figure watches stealthily in the shadows: The Mage, an enigmatic being whose true intentions remain unclear.

- The Continent
The distant land beyond the sea, where the protagonist (Axel) comes from. A place of advanced technology, sprawling cities, and a society that has long forgotten the old ways. The Continent is a place of mystery and wonder because no one from the island has ever been there and in general, the islanders are afraid of the unknown.

**The Central Conflict**
Something is changing on the island. The Patch is no longer just a forbidden place—it is reacting, awakening. The inhabitants are restless. Some believe it is a sign of impending doom, while others see it as an opportunity to uncover something powerful.

The island’s ruler, Lady Katrina, has imposed strict restrictions, fearing what may be unleashed. However, not everyone is willing to obey. Recently, Lady Katrina hired someone called Axel from the Continent (the player and protagonist) to find out the truth behind The Patch. Though Katrina's hiring remains a secret (only her and The Mage knows Axel's identity), Axel will have to speak with the island's inhabitants to gather information and make decisions that will shape the island's future.

No one except The Mage and Lady Katrina knows Axel, the rest only knows that there is someone wandering around the island from the Continent but nothing else. They will have to meet Axel and decide if they trust him or not.

The question remains: who will dare to uncover the truth, and at what cost?
